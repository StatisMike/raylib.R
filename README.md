# Raylib.R

R bindings for raylib.

raylib is a simple and easy-to-use library to enjoy videogames programming.

raylib is highly inspired by Borland BGI graphics lib
and by XNA framework and it's specially well suited for prototyping,
tooling, graphical applications, embedded systems and education.

_NOTE for ADVENTURERS: raylib is a programming library to enjoy videogames programming;
no fancy interface, no visual helpers, no debug button...
just coding in the most pure spartan-programmers way._
